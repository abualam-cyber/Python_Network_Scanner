# Python_Network_Scanner

This network scanner application scans a network and IP and prints out a list of open, and closed ports.

This program allows to specify a network range and a range of ports to scan. It will then iterate over all IP addresses in that range, attempting to connect to each IP on the specified ports. After scanning, it prints the IP address along with its open and closed ports. 

Please note that scanning networks without permission is against network policies and illegal.
